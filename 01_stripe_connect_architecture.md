- Customers pay the platform  
- Platform holds funds until delivery completion  
- Revenue is split between chef + app  
- Chefs are paid daily via batch payouts

## Payment Flow Architecture

### Step 1 — Customer Checkout
Customer pays through platform checkout:

Customer → Stripe Checkout → Platform Balance

### Step 2 — Platform as Merchant of Record
Platform controls full charge, refunds, disputes, and settlement timing.

- Platform calculates chef share
- Transfers chef portion
